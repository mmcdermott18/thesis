			<h1>What does it take to be original?</h1>
			<p>I know this may seem it is taken a little too far or outside the realm of what should actually be considered but I'm going to go there anyway.</p>
			<p>Where does originility end and where does it begin? I assume most people's opinion varies as to degrees of originality but I'm here to argue that at this point in history, it is impossible to be completely original. This arguement is silly, I will admit that in the begining but it is more of a catalyst for thought than for actual real project.</p>
			<p>So what is original and what isn't. The most basic idea for originality seems to involve doing something no one else has done before &mdash; seems easy enough &mdash; but how far does that go? If I am designing a poster and I want to be &ldquo;original&rdquo; what does it really mean? Can I use someone else's images? Probably not. Can I use someone else's typeface? Probably shouldn't. Can I use a known language? Only if you came up with the langue. Can I use someone else's paper, printer, or inks? I would argue no. All of those things have been appropriated from somewhere else. To make a truely original poster I would have to raise grow a tree or grow some cotton. Take that raw material and make paper using tools I made and I have no idea how to make a screen fine enough to actually be useful in the paper making process. Let's say I actually get to make paper. Now I have to make some ink from some berries I grew and use a stick from my tree as a writing instrument. Then I can make some marks on the paper, language, atleast readable by others, is out of the question because I didn't come up with that so simple scribbles seem like the way to go. It seems like then I can stop and maybe have an original poster. But then I look at it and it looks like something any four year old with crayons makes every day in pre school, thus, not original.</p>
			<p>All of that is to expalin that being original is a lose lose for anyone involved. Almost anything I do today has been done or someone else in some other place is doing it at the exact same time. It is impossibly hard to be the only person in the world thinking of something, there are just too many people and there is too much access to the exact same tools and ideas.</p>
			<p>The point I'm making is that being original is an outdated idea. In today's culture, we have to embrace the idea of appropriation whether intentional or not. We need to take that idea and run with it. It opens up infinitely more possibilities than trying to be original does.</p>
